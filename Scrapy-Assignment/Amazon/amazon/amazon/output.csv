I grew up surrounded and bombarded by late \'60s/early \'70s feminist messages predicated on the idea that men and boys are bad and girls and women were the only ones with the positive traits that the world needed. Wired as a sensitive, intuitive boy, I picked up on the messages that I was inherently bad and that my greatest gift to society would be to elevate and support women ... while determinedly NOT BEING, trying to have my existence have as little impact on women and girls as possible. By age 10, I wanted to die. When a boy hears women saying things within earshot of him like, ""Men are the urine on the toilet seat of life"" (yes, a woman in a group I was in said that), it\'s easy for him in his immature understanding to think that the most altruistic thing he could do for the women and girls of the world would be to die.'), ('Chris Norden', 'But had my parents had read this life-saving book—YOU ARE AN AMAZING BOY—to me at bedtime, I would have grown up knowing—not in a stuck-up way, but rather in a benevolent way—that I was amazing, strong, capable, loving, that as a boy, I had good, helpful and valuable qualities, qualities that were a BLESSING—NOT a curse— to society, to girls and women, to men and other boys, to animals and the planet.

Single, not by choice--her boyfriend of six years cheated on her with a successful corporate woman, while Jess has been waiting tables at a circus themed restaurant and trying to sell any of her paintings.

Jess finishes her shower in Aiden's bathroom, emerges from his  bedroom, which she's moved into--typical younger sister behavior--and charms Conor with her down-to-earth personality and cute looks. Meanwhile, she's rendered speechless by his extreme handsomeness and gently teasing comments.

His description of pasta left my mouth watering to the point that I made spaghetti that very night.  He begins by talking about his mother\'s love of food:  ""there was a daily, almost obsessive focus on the quality of the ingredients, their careful preparation the passing on of family recipes, and cultural and culinary traditions.""  Weaving stories, recipes, and descriptions of food experiences and traditions we learn about Tucci as a young man, actor, and family man.  We also learn about his values.  For example, his mother exhorted, ""You can\'t know if you don\'t like something if you haven\'t had it.  You have to try it.  You have to try everything.""  He described food as ""connective tissue"" bringing people together.  Tucci noted, ""if you\'re a food lover, there is always something gratifying about connecting with the vegetable, the fruit, or whatever animal, whether you\'ve grown it, raised it, or hunted it, before it becomes your food.  But to make that connection and then connect with someone else simultaneously is an exalted, almost spiritual level of foodie intimacy.""  He reserved his experience of throat cancer until the chapter.  It was as though, the prior chapters were the prelude to fully understanding how threatening oropharyngeal cancer would be to a man who clearly loves food.  His diagnosis meant that for almost two years, he primarily ate easy to swallow foods.  Reflecting, he said: ""Food at once grounded me and took me to other places.  It comforted me and challenged me.  It was part of the fabric that made up my creative self and my domestic self.""')]"

I'd say 80% of those people don't know the extent to which this exodus devastated native Nations and mired them in distrust. This book offers a window with a wide view, touching a little on many other nations, but focusing on John Ross, Principle Cheif for the Cherokee, and Andrew Jackson, U.S. general and President. The author draws lines between them for their situations in early life, battles fought together, tenacity, and desire to do what they thought their people wanted. He then drives them apart with Jackson's betray, broken promises, deceit, selfishness, and tangled legal web. The mere fact that Jackson withheld his veto (by a day) on a bill his supporters wanted, just to approve an illegitimate treaty, speaks volumes. It's maddening to know how close Ross was to success. Just a vote--if only the voters had realized they were about to sacrifice their moral compass just to cast their lots with someone who would betray their interests as well.""), ('Danielle', ""I found this book a great resource on all the legal avenues and order of events.

To hold a land lottery and give away thriving farms right out from under people's feet. A state's right to ignore the Supreme Court and have Jackson turn a blind eye. The right to buy and sell human beings became the cornerstone, once natives left. Occasionally a state defies federal law in a way we consider moral, but these particular acts wouldn't stand today.

  The Taming of Lions ,Out of Print--Limited Availability.,"What if the key to your future was to unlock the secrets of someone else’s past? ""I was once a lion tamer...Or was it that I herded sheep?"" —is the burning question etched in Charlie Gates's mind. For a man who forgets things so easily, he seems to have an easier time recalling memories of a life that wasn't exactly his. Or was it? Struggling to piece together his forgotten past, he ends up befriending Edward Barrett, a young man who needs a little help of his own —but with his future. Through the bonds of an unexpected friendship, crossing several generations of past and present time, the two men learn that sometimes fiction, although not always real, has the power to expose the most truth. Readers of Water for Elephants and The Notebook are calling The Taming of Lions 'an inspirational and thought-provoking read!'",978-0692097571,"[('Amazon Customer', ""What I thought: Wow. Just wow. I don't read contemporary that often (when I do, it's in the romantic comedic vein of Sophie Kinsella or Helen Fielding), but I was intrigued by the premise of The Notebook meets Water for Elephants, I knew I had to give it a try. I was not disappointed. The Taming of Lions is a quieter story that will remain with you long after you've finished the book. I have so much respect for authors who can pull off symbolism in their novels without literally beating their readers in the face with it and Danie does just that (her way of bringing up her themes in the novel were on a level I don't think I could ever reach). Her characters are so well fleshed out, I felt like I was reading a memoir about real people and not a work of fiction. This is a book I don't think I can recommend enough!""), ('Marisa Tishner', 'The Quote: I was once a lion tamer...Or was it that I herded sheep?'), ('Natasha', 'Why I chose it: This was actually tough. Danie has several amazing quotes (2nd place went to: ""Too many things are carelessly throw about in this world and love should never be one of them.""), but I decided to go with the one that started it all. Pulling off a memorable first quote is hard and Danie nailed it! It\'s a line with so many layers and symbols that creep up again and again in this novel and its one of the reasons I loved it so much!')]"

Although his past was alluded to, it was always shrouded in mystery and I was content with that. Suddenly, I come across this book (12 years after it's original release) and it intrigued me. I didn't have any expectations and I read that it was set in the 1800's. Ok, that's not an issue for me. Why would it be? Wolverine is over a 100 years old after all.""), ('Stanley Fu', ""This is the true origin of Wolverine, taking us through a significant part of his childhood to young adult. It's not a traditional superhero story full of big battles and  cheesy one liners. It is a serious novel that provides revelations into Wolverines early life, showing the influence that part of his life had on partly moulding what he is today. It does this through great story telling that involves the melancholy, child abuse, domestic violence, classism, love, hate, rejection, friendship and great tragedy, with a mutant twist. It tells of how logan got his name, gives us an insight into his part feral nature, why he likes red heads and shows us the moment his claws were known to exist. But more than concrete revelation, it is full of exciting mystery as we are left to decide who Wolverine's real father is..i.e. the grounds keeper who looks just like him or the estate owner (i guess it's pretty obvious who it is). What is the story behind Wolverine's (or James Howlett's as he was known then) deceased brother? Why does his mother have the scars of 3 claw marks on her back? These answer to  things aren't spelt out for you but rather implied and you have to work it out yourself. The story also introduces us to the redhead nanny who looks after him and the groundkeepers son who seems to hate James. So there is mystery and conspiracy within this book, not to mention great drama. The story also ends in a way that shows how he may have met up with silverfox."")]"

Her tales, which emphasized unknowable power and mystery and the importance of protective rituals, didn't provide comprehension of phenomena but a way to live with them.

  Berlin Diary , $11.99 ,The author of the international bestseller ,,"[('Amazon Customer', 'If you are a follower of the events of WWII, this is the second best book to read!! The first best  is Shirer\'s other book ""The Rise and Fall of the  Third Reich"". This man was a journalist in Germany on the radio during the war and has written with amazing insight to the events that led up to Hitler\'s realm of power and eventual collapse. If you have ever wondered how events could have gone that far, these two books tell it as it was through his own personal experiences at the time and other correspondences from the newspapers, radio, and personal connections with the  Nazis. This diary is written and notating his thoughts as the events were happening all around him. It has great personal worth and feelings. The ""Rise"" book goes into all that happened combining his personal experiences as well as info that occurred during  the  Nuremberg trials.  You can\'t know as much as you think you do about Germany WWI  until  you have read these 2 books. I also recommend that you also go one step further and should read ""Mein  Kampf"" by Hitler.  It is not just an evil book written to talk you into hating Jewish people. Don\'t worry , you won\'t be brainwashed into becoming a Nazi, I promise you.  It is an amazing book that actually tells you directly from  Hitler\'s own mind (not from some  writer who conjectures what was going on) why he did what he did. When you read this  book, you will understand so much more about why and how Hitler did his infamous deeds. (He actually believed that God inspired him to his actions for the sake of Germany, the  fatherland and its owners. It is  ponderous and at times you may want to quit it, but you will be rewarded with many scary and insightful  statements that give important clues about his reason for his actions. You will be amazed about how astute he was on some issues and psychology. It is unfortunate that he, like so many other dictators, eventually go completely mad with power which, fortunately for all of us, result in their eventual downfall. It is a crying shame that it ends with the deaths of so many innocent people over the whole world.'), ('Gordon R. Thomas', ""One of the tragedies of history is that there are true Cassandras among us - voices we should listen to but don't, until it's too late. William L. Shirer was one of those (and Winston Churchill another at the time), in the years prior to World War II. Prophets, really. Both men had the ability to see clearly into Hitler's heart and soul, into the black pit of looming catastrophe that was right in front of us, but which most people at the time did not want to see. If the problem is how to discern the prophet from the charlatan, one bit of guidance might be to trust the educated eyewitness. Throughout his Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941 (not '49 as Amazon has it on this Review site), William L. Shirer is literally everywhere important in Europe - from Paris to Rome to Gdansk, let alone Berlin - during Hitler's rise, and calls it as he sees it, right on the money. To experience his prescience, now in hindsight, is to wonder in bewilderment at the delusion of the democracies as the most dangerous movement in modern history took hold of the German state. As a side light, it is also a fascinating look at early transatlantic news broadcasting, as CBS and Shirer did everything they could to get his broadcasts to the U.S. on schedule. His information stream had a lot to do with weakening the intense U.S. isolationist movement of the period that inspired such caution in FDR despite his full knowledge of what needed to be done. Reading this book made me feel the immediacy of the moment despite the 75+ years in between. I consider it not only a highly recommended read, but also a required one for anyone interested in the history of World War II.""), ('Peter Tenney', ""I downloaded this for Kindle, when considering whether to buy the Churchill Trilogy for Christmas. As a refresher for WWII and considering the current media reporting of the Far East (not much) I thought it might be a interesting look at war from the correspondents point of view. It is more than that, for history lovers and concerned current event followers, as it reads like a novel but gives much insider information that is gathered by a reporter, that either doesn't get printed and written up in later history books and then current large newspapers and publications, even from inside a highly difficult and censored German and Europe preparing, than entering WWII."")]"

When Stout began the series all the regulars were in place.  Nero was an established detective, successful enough to maintain the brownstone staffed by Fritz and Theodore with the assistance of Archie to handle the necessary errands outside as well as any secretarial tasks that might arise.  From the odds and ends Stout let drop from time to time we learned that Wolfe had originally come from Montenegro where he had let an adventurous life while Archie was originally from Ohio and had traveled to New York City to seek adventure and his fortune but Stout never told us how the unlikely pair had ever even met, much less came to work together.'), ('Jim Davis', ""After Stout's death his estate asked Goldsborough to continue the series, which he has done by authoring several volumes of featuring the pair set at various times in their long career.  This time though Goldsborough tells the story of just how Archie came to work for Wolfe.

Tate is a very compelling heroine…she’s just one of these extremely relatable girls that is easy to fall in love with…and it’s easy to see why Miles did as well..')]"

  Effective Software Project Management , $11.99 ,"Why another book on software project management? For some time, the fields of project management, computer science, and software development have been growing rapidly and concurrently. Effective support for the enterprise demands the merging of these efforts into a coordinated discipline, one that incorporates best practices from both systems development and project management life cycles. Robert K. Wysocki creates that discipline in this book--a ready reference for professionals and consultants as well as a textbook for students of computer information systems and project management. By their very nature, software projects defy a ""one size fits all"" approach. In these pages you will learn to apply best-practice principles while maintaining the flexibility that's essential for successful software development. Learn how to make the planning process fit the need * Understand how and why software development must be planned on a certainty-to-uncertainty continuum * Categorize your projects on a four-quadrant model * Learn when to use each of the five SDPM strategies--Linear, Incremental, Iterative, Adaptive, and Extreme * Explore the benefits of each strategic model and what types of projects it supports best * Recognize the activities that go into the Scoping, Planning, Launching, Monitoring/Controlling, and Closing phases of each strategy * Apply this knowledge to the specific projects you manage * Get a clear picture of where you are and how to get where you want to go",,"[('SirChan', ""I have taken many courses in project management who's techniques are more geared towards defined or construction style projects and so are most books out there in the market, this book is a refreshing departure from the norm as it integrates SDLC (s) both traditional and modern with project management processes. The author gives good insight in choosing the appropriate SDLC for a given situation and then elaborates for the chosen SDLC how to set expectations, milestones and deliverables for: requirements, WBS, cost, stakeholders etc. The book does a good job at conveying the essence of the SDLC(s) and Project Management techniques however, depending on your background, I recommend that you read two books, one on SDLC (Craig Larman's Agile & Iterative development ISBN 0131111558) and the other on Project Management (Kathy Schwalbe's Information Technology Project Management ISBN: 0619215267) prior to reading this book.""), ('John Matlock', 'This book tends to be more on the soft side of project management, which is important, however to give good balance I feel that the next edition could add more hardcore techniques and metrics.

  The Boy in the Striped Pajamas , $8.99 ,Two young boys encounter the best and worst of humanity during the Holocaust in this powerful read that ,,"[('Amazon Customer', ""It is quite possible that more has been written about The Holocaust than any other historical event in history. Not just in regard to hard research, but many of the world's finest novelists have fictionalized the story, film makers have touched upon the subject, playwrights, composers, painters and poets. If there has been a way to express the shock- and shock is an understatement in this case- it has been attempted.""), ('David Seaman', ' John Boyne, a gifted and now internationally known Irish author, wrote the book ""The Boy In The Stripped Pajamas"" in about two weeks time. As he said, in order to maintain ""the voice,"" once he began he was afraid to stop. The same is true when reading it- we are compelled to continue and it is evident from early in the book that Boyne has disguised the terminal words so that it can apply to any and all of the other holocausts\' that occurred prior to and after this one. In fact, only once does Boyne choose to use a ""telling"" word; on page 54 one of the officers says, ""Heil Hitler"" but then we are told that the boy assumed that this was like saying, ""Well, goodbye for now and have a pleasant afternoon.""'), ('RJL', ' The boy, his name Bruno; his age nine, misunderstands the key words and Auschwitz is written as ""Out-With"" every single time. The negative pun- the only way I could describe this- suggests the old work rhythm, ""In with the good; out with the bad."" Then the boy mishears the Furher as The Fury"" and this negative pun needs no description at all. We have a moment when Bruno meets ""The Fury"" as well as ""her"" when they come for dinner and Bruno is appalled at how small The Fury is, but how kind the beautiful blonde woman with him is (her name is simply Eva).')]"

  A Death in the Family , $11.99 ,"The classic American novel, re-published for the 100th anniversary of James Agee's birth",,"[('anya leone', ""This is one of the most touching books I've ever read. Agee has the greatest knack of talking in the language of the character under examination. His attention to minute detail brings the picture of what the characters see and do and feel in a way that I find rather profound. The language is never coarse or overly broad. You never have to guess what a sentence is conveying, it is so literate yet to the point. For instance, Agee names all the mourners, just the way a child would who was watching them pass by one by one, and creates an atmosphere of the burden of sadness but not understanding why the burden is put forth.""), ('Donna Lynch', ""Young Rufus' character and personality come across as the most touching of all. He is a young boy starting to mature but still captured in childhood, and trying to understand people and their behaviors toward him, trying to trust but knowing and feeling puzzled by the things people do to him to destroy that trust. And learning he can't trust himself either. Everyone can relate to his trials in this regard. All the folks who populate this book are folks you'd want to know more about. But the most touching aspect of all is the way Agee lets you know just how the death of one impacts so many, so very many others; how it hurts, how it forces growth, how much sadness it generates. I couldn't put it down. And my tears still flow thinking about it.""), ('Daniel Myers', ""A great American classic that I had never read before.  I was a bit disappointed.  I enjoyed the glimpse into the early 20th century in Knoxville, Tennessee.  Briefly I lived in the same neighborhood in the 1990s.  It seemed to be a collection of essays, some of which didn't quite fit together.  The language was lovely but there was a lot of verbal diarrhea - places where he went on and on when the same point could have been made in half as many words (for instance the discussion of Rufus standing by his house waiting for the big boys to come by before/after school)."")]"

  Spartacus , $9.99 ,"Spartacus, a fictionalization of a slave revolt in ancient Rome in 71 BC, is well known today because of the 1960 movie starring Kirk Douglas and Laurence Olivier. It was originally published in 1951 by Fast himself, after being turned down by every mainstream publisher of the day because of Fast's blacklisting for his Communist Party sympathies. The story of Spartacus, born a slave, trained as a gladiator, who led a slave revolt that was eventually put down by Crassus, was immensely popular, and went on to sell millions of copies. The reprinting of this title in the North Castle series brings back into print a book that many regard as a classic.",,"[('M. G Watson', '""Spartacus"" gives the lie to the scientific law that two bodies cannot occupy the same space: it exists simultaneously as an epic piece of historical fiction and as powerful (if less-than-subtle) bit of Leftist propaganda. The fact that most people know the story of Spartacus from the Kirk Douglas movie is a shame, because while the movie remains a classic, the book does the story far more justice.'), ('Phil from Fargo', 'Everyone knows the basic story of Spartacus, the anonymous third-generation slave sold to a gladiator school to fight for the amusement of decadent Romans, and how he ended up leading a gigantic slave rebellion that nearly destroyed the Republic. What Fast explores in the novel is how and why this rebellion came about, and what effect it had on the psychology of the Romans, whose culture even during the years of the Republic was enormously dependent on slavery. Most importantly, Fast explores the moral climate of Rome by following around the ""victors"" of the Servile War as they reminisce about Spartacus and how he was defeated. It is in this backward-looking manner that ""Spartacus"" unfolds.'), ('E.S. Kraay', 'Fast draws his characters, most of whom are real-life figures, with wonderful clarity: Crassus, the general who crushed Spartacus\' rebellion, is shown as ""the bronze hawk of the Republic"" -- ruthless, sensual, grasping, yet ultimately hollow; Cicero, the historian-philsopher, as a scheming opportunist of the worst sort; Gracchus as a basically decent man turned cynical and decayed by the evils of his society. The lesser Roman characters are much worse: empty-headed, venal, vain, cruel, parastic, sexually depraved, almost unspeakably vicious and treacherous, all holding onto illicit fortunes wrung from the sweat and labor of slaves, and all desperate to increase their wealth, power and position relative to each other. Nor are the common folk of the cities and towns spared: Fast depicts them in passing as a lazy, bloodthirsty, amoral mob who live for cheap wine and the grain dole and the games, who ""strangle their children at birth"" and whore themselves on the streets for pennies.')]"

Unfortunately for him he never managed to convince Leopold II or Franz to let him fight against Napoleon (although he was rash enough to declare that Napoleon was only succesful because the Austrians were not led by himself). Outside his military life he was a writer, poet and socialite, being a valued guest at pretty much all European courts, chatting with Frederick the Great, drinking tea with Catherine the Great, gossiping with Marie Antoinette, being frowned upon for his loose behaviour by Maria Theresa & debating with Joseph II.

  Truth above All: The Japuji of Guru Nanak , $8.14 ,"Truth above All: the Japuji of Guru Nanak is an objective and rational interpretation of the Japuji the opening verse of the Adi Granth, the Sikh scripture. Penned by Nanak, the first Guru of the Sikhs, it occupies a pivotal position in Sikh Philosophy. The coded language and compact style of this verse make it easy to recite but difficult to understand. Though most Sikhs chant it daily in the morning, few of them claim to know its authentic meaning. The void between chanting and understanding has led to a mushroom growth of interpretations of the text.All these interpretations, however, portray it as a manual of worship while on closure look it displays the characteristics of a manual of science. Scripted by Guru Nanak in the medieval times when all science was in infancy, it may truly be called the first ever manifesto of science. However, because it appeared before the intellectual environment was ripe for its right evaluation it was listed as a religious text and began to be used as such.The work in hand does not share the assumptions and beliefs expressed in this type of interpretations. Brushing aside their subjective bias and methodological flaws, it makes an objective approach to narrow down on the original message of the Master contained in this unique composition. Confining strictly to the domain of objectivity, it applies the proven techniques of scientific method for decoding and interpreting this poetic text. It makes a realistic attempt to trace the possible correlations between the wisdom contained in this classic and the vision of the modern science. It is neither an opinion nor a religious discourse but a positive endeavor to read the mind of Guru Nanak through his own creation.",,

The scales are the musical language to help you understand and play the piano.",,"[('Valerie Spaulding', 'Firstly, this is in black and white yet it\'s written as though it\'s in color (e.g. ""play from the yellow note to the blue note as shown""). Secondly, there are typos as confirmed by outside resources. It tells you the finger patterns then proceeds to explain how to play your first scale in C Major, only to leave out your 4th finger in the descending scale altogether. ""5321321"" when it should be ""54321321"". Thirdly, there is the most random religious note near the beginning out of no where which was unnecessary as it had no piano-playing information. Each chapter repeats the same oddities just for other scales and really carries no value, let alone $20 worth. This is largely overpriced; I highly recommend a different resource than this book for your piano-playing curiosities.')]"

Croly wrote this book at a time there was much debate as to which direction the country should take.  This book is extremely well written.  It is impressive how Croly was able to put his thoughts to paper so well.  The book is a must read should you wish to gain insight on how America has changed since the Civil War. And from a conservative perspective, I must add, it's very scary.""), ('Dennis Nicholls', 'My review concerns the quality of the ""Qontro Classic Books"" paperback edition, not the content of Croly\'s book.  Croly originally published the work in 1909 and it apparently has passed into the public domain.  This Qontro edition is an oversize paperback, but is very hard to read because it is set in a small and hard to read typefont - I think it\'s just Courier.  I would guess the publisher scanned a library copy into Word and hit the Print button.  The table of contents doesn\'t give page numbers for the beginning of chapters.  There is no forward or other comments by recent scholars, just the bare text of Croly\'s book.'), ('Jason Galbraith', ""I was first drawn to this book because of its emphasis on the distinction between Jeffersonian and Hamiltonian thought.  It was written by Herbert Croly, a progressive born in 1869, when he was forty years old.  Croly had his blind spots -- there is nothing in this book about women's rights and virtually nothing about African-American rights, for which I deduct one star.  His thought appears to be highly idiosyncratic.  For example, he has this to say about the Constitution:"")]"

Taking time off from college, Dana evolution from green sailor to seasoned seaman is the most interesting aspect of the book, though the historical records of California in the 1830s, the trade in animal skins, and the personalities of hid bosses and co-workers is another strength of the book. The journey itself demonstrates the danger and hardships of those aboard; a bit more detail perhaps than was necessary. However, overall a good book reflecting the times that Dana lived.

While some of the phrases might be long and the child might skip around, they rhyme well and are funny. I can picture the child trying really hard to say 'Quoggles' and laughing before they finish vocalizing the word! Above all, what I personally got from the book was a realization that fear is all in our heads, and it takes gentle guidance and the courage to try a new way of approaching the problem to really cross a difficult bridge.

  Every Boy’s Book: A Complete Encyclopædia of Sports and Amusements , $4.99 ,"It would be impossible for a single author to produce a book of this description with a fair prospect of success, because it necessarily treats of many subjects; and a perfect acquaintance with some of the more important would occupy a lifetime. The reading and researches of one man would not be sufficiently extensive to embrace the rich variety of the materials required. Being fully convinced of this fact, the Publishers have endeavoured to obtain the aid of the most distinguished writers in the various departments of knowledge which the following pages are intended to illustrate. Thus each contributor, in furnishing his quota of information for the work, has been engaged in a congenial task, one best suited to his peculiar turn of mind, as well as to his individual acquirements, and one upon which he could, therefore, with the greatest ease and accuracy dilate. This brief explanation will show in what spirit the Publishers embarked in the undertaking; and the accompanying list of the writers may be received as a proof that they have succeeded in securing the services of the most competent authorities. With that portion of the book with which he was practically acquainted each of the following gentlemen has dealt: W. Martin, Esq., C. Baker, Esq., R. B. Wormald, Esq., J. F. Wood, Esq., A. McLaren, Esq., Stonehenge, author of “Rural Sports,” and the Rev. J. G. Wood, author of several works on Natural History, who also furnished some of the designs.

Anyway, I do recommend this book if you have read the others, just don't set your expectations too high. If you haven't read any books in the series, start with the first one, The Inn At Eagle Point. You won't be disappointed.""), ('jac', 'This is the fourth book in the Chesapeake Shores series by Sherryl Woods.  She is a wonderful writer if you are interested in family/personality-type books.  It is a LARGE Irish family living in the northeast and each of the books in this series contains all/most of the members in the family.  However, most of the books are centered around one or two of the family members and their lives/problems/dreams.  I have now finished all but one of the books in this series and have loved each one.  The people all have such different and distinct personalities and there is some feuding, but all of the members of the family always stick together and support each other.  For someone desiring to read stories of ""happily ever after -mostly"" this is a delightful series.  I now have a friend that wants to borrow the books to read after hearing my thoughts on the books.  I picked up my first book when on a trip and it was the 8th book in the series.  I was somewhat ""lost"" in keeping the members of the family separate, but now that I have re-read that book, it was so much more interesting.  After the first one, I have searched bookstores, library book sales, and on-line dealers to finish completing my set!  It was well worth the effort and I am sure I will be re-reading this series several times!')]"

I came across with this book in Amazon which shows the facts and beauty of Provence and I liked it. The book will give you ideas on how this place is a good itinerary for your vacation. Suggestion on what places to visit and the best activities to do with each place are provided on this book. There were also tips on where the best accommodations are located as well the the restaurants to dine in. Good guide indeed.""), ('KMinKY', ""This is the worst travel guide I have ever purchased. It gives only the most basic information with no details. For example, it suggests visiting 3 museums in Nice, but doesn't give any reasons why. It provides only the name, address, phone number and website for each museum, but no hours, admission costs, or helpful tips on what to see. There is no practical information about where or how to use public transportation. It lists only 1-2 restaurants in each city. The lack of detail is not due to lack of space. This book uses a large font and huge margins, with lots of wasted space. It spends 2 entire pages on a chart listing 16 national holidays in France. If I could give this book 0 stars, I would.""), ('Angelique Johnson', ""Planning to tour during the summer. It's a bit too early to plan at the moment but I saw this book in a promotion in a site. Got it in a really awesome deal! Anyways, I breezed through this book and realized that it's a beautiful place. I like how it comes with tips and recommendations like proper greeting etiquette and french phrases for emergencies which I loved because you'll never know when something wrong happens but it's better to be safe and sorry, right? At least people would be able to understand me. I hope the numbers given in this book are active because I'm planning to give them a dial later on and inquire. The itineraries given are well planned and I would consider following through them."")]"

Finger', 'The title of the book takes its cue from the author’s attempt to navigate the waters of being single, gay, and Christian. For Greg, his identity is rooted firmly in Christ.

He makes clear through his witness that our only response as evangelicals to the current sexual revolution is a further commitment to a traditional sexual ethic. In his asides, which are personally my favorite parts of the book, he stresses a gospel of grace and hope. That our only hope is one in which Christ redeems the entirety of our being.

I love the Hillary Greene series and was sorry to see her go, wondering if Faith Martin could invent a new character to steal my heart like Hillary did.  This is the 3rd book in the new series and by far the best. It left me wanting more and I can’t wait for the 4th book.  Clement Ryder has Parkinson’s disease, causing him to give up his life as a surgeon. Through the first 3 books, Trudy is suspicious that he might be an alcoholic as she glimpses subtle signs of his disease. She finally discovers the truth in an unconventional way and realizes how wrong she was about him. We won’t really know how she handles this information until the next book, but we do know that this elderly doctor and young police cadet have become close and fast friends who compliment each other while working together on a murder case. Once again Faith Martin has made her characters lovable, believable and oh so very real.
