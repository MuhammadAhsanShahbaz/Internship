The suggested five day itineraries look like they'll be particularly useful for me - though I may well swap a few things around.

Gaet, Hoemei and Joesai are three sons of the old Prime Predictor, Tae ran-Kaiel of the Kaiel clan. They are bound to each other, as well as their two wives, Noe and Teenae. They hope to soon complete their most-desirable Six-marriage with Kathein, a scientist. But the new Prime Predictor, Aesoe, has other plans.... In order to gain an outlet to the sea, Aesoe orders the brothers to marry Oelita, the Clanless One. The Gentle Heretic has a legion of followers that would give the Kaiel allies against their powerful opponents, and a foothold in the coastal lands. The brothers choose to court Oelitaand have her prove her worththrough a complicated Death Ritual. Oelita has the audacity to question the existence of the God of the Skywho has begun to speak. Pestilence, plague and conflict are brewing across the land.

She feels the same and they go to dinner and then end with a hot night of passion. Avery thinks it's for one night only, not realizing Hudson is from the same town. But this country boy said he wanted her forever and meant it. This story is OTT, instalove steam at its finest. Their chemistry is hot 🔥 hot 🔥 hot 🔥. The drama is low and the ending is super happy.

By around the midway point, as the pilgrimage is underway, the story picks up and the plot begins to take shape. The mystery around Inara and her powers and connection to a god kept me guessing and Elogast's unwavering loyalty and love of baking had my whole heart. And while not every character is immediately lovable (looking at you, Skedi), by the end, I was rooting for them all."

Rome is a beautiful city, rich in culture, history, art and food, but can seem a little overwhelming when confronted with the inevitable double edged sword of travelling – too many things to see, too little time to see them all. “Rome for Tourists” is the most useful guide to help you with the seemingly overwhelming planning process. Unlike other tourist guides, this book is loaded with tips and secrets that Rome locals try to keep to themselves. The book lists several hole-in-the-wall restaurants, an array of accommodation (categorized by price range), must-see sites as well as spots in the city that are unknown to most tourists but are definitely worth visiting. I’m pretty sure this book will be the cause of my rebooking a trip to Rome for this coming summer season."

        "This book has got to be one of the most complete guides there is in travelling.  I like how it inspires the reader to get into the London mood by suggesting films to watch before the trip.  Also it has practical tips on Etiquette, tips, passports, visas etc.  I like how the 5 day itinerary is presented - seems very streamlined and easy to follow.  I need not research much on other sources since I sincerely believe everything there is to know about the trip is contained in this book.  This is truly a wonderful compilation of information from well - travelled authors.  Congratulations for a great travel book!"

This is the 3rd book in the new series and by far the best. It left me wanting more and I can’t wait for the 4th book.  Clement Ryder has Parkinson’s disease, causing him to give up his life as a surgeon. Through the first 3 books, Trudy is suspicious that he might be an alcoholic as she glimpses subtle signs of his disease. She finally discovers the truth in an unconventional way and realizes how wrong she was about him. We won’t really know how she handles this information until the next book, but we do know that this elderly doctor and young police cadet have become close and fast friends who compliment each other while working together on a murder case. Once again Faith Martin has made her characters lovable, believable and oh so very real. I can’t help but lose myself in her books once I open to page 1."

It also gave me clarity on aspects of the business side of things that, to me, have mostly been based on hear-say."

Dicho sistema se mantiene en su lugar debido a nuestra proyección de un mundo serio - a nivel personal y colectivo - cuyo propósito es que dirijamos nuestra atención hacia el cuerpo. De esta manera no prestamos atención a la mente tomadora de decisiones, que es al mismo tiempo la fuente del problema y la solución. Pero el ego se deshace fácilmente cuando prestamos atención al amable hombrecillo (símbolo de Jesús) que está justo detrás de nosotros, y que siempre nos recuerda que nos riamos de su chiste: \"Es un chiste pensar que el tiempo pudiese llegar a circunscribir a la eternidad....\" Su presencia amorosa nos anima a afrontar la seriedad del ego, en todas sus formas, con una risa amable, un tierno cosquilleo y una dulce sonrisa.",

Eighteen-year-old Michelle \"Mikey\" is struggling to figure out what to do with her life since tragedy struck her family. Suddenly friends from her mother's old life show up and she take a leap of faith to join the circus for the summer. Things aren't as glitter and glam as they appear from the outside and Mikey is in for even more surprises when a comet makes impact. I really enjoyed this story and how the author handled the imagery with the dark and dirty side of the circus and the magic of what happens to Mikey. I can't wait to read more of the story in the next book."

It focuses on an immigrant child who is new to a school and does not speak any English yet. He feels ostracized and is bullied and the main character stands up for him and offers kindness. I'm a social worker and I love that this is centered in the book, my husband is also an immigrant so it's one more bonus lesson for my daughter to see how immigrant children might feel.

The so call JUDGE did this \"its all a dirty LIE over money money money\" We did put together a very powerful letter for TV but never made it.  Just find someone who's feelings are not involved can very well help - Good Luck! May the Universe be with you."

From Insider Tips for Tourist, Overview of Paris, France and so much more. It is great also because they include the best places for Travelers on a Budget! We all knew the Paris is well known for being one of the most expensive city in Europe and it's wonderful they include the BEST places for Travelers on a Budget!  Great Job!"

Reading the book, it was well structured and pleasing to the eyes, the author utilized bold and italicized fonts making the information easily be found. This is really a good book that you can bring along with you when you go to Paris because it has all that you need!"

        "I didn't expect to get a comprehensive travel guide for $3. I just wanted some useful info I could have on my phone without needing to carry the Rick Steves or Lonely Planet book, or incurring data charges to look up addresses, hours, etc. However, if this were a book, I doubt it would be twenty pages, and it's predominately a series of links to websites. For example, it tells you most major museums are closed one day out of the week, but the authors didn't take the time to actually list the hours--it simply provides links to the actual museums. Most free apps like Trip Advisor have far more information, and I think most people know how to use google to find the website for the Louvre. You can download the free samples for any of the legit guides and get this information in the first few pages. As for the 5 days...the fifth tells you to head over to Montmarte, names the 3 major tourist sites, then advises you to \"spend the rest of your day however you'd like...\". There are numerous free blogs with detailed walking tours of Montmarte. Day 5 doesn't even take up half a page. As stated, for $3, I didn't expect much--but our own itinerary is more detailed than this. It feels like a joke to make money. I know it was cheap, but I still feel scammed."

It provides only the name, address, phone number and website for each museum, but no hours, admission costs, or helpful tips on what to see. There is no practical information about where or how to use public transportation. It lists only 1-2 restaurants in each city. The lack of detail is not due to lack of space. This book uses a large font and huge margins, with lots of wasted space. It spends 2 entire pages on a chart listing 16 national holidays in France. If I could give this book 0 stars, I would."

I like how it comes with tips and recommendations like proper greeting etiquette and french phrases for emergencies which I loved because you'll never know when something wrong happens but it's better to be safe and sorry, right? At least people would be able to understand me. I hope the numbers given in this book are active because I'm planning to give them a dial later on and inquire. The itineraries given are well planned and I would consider following through them."

While I do not have the mind of a child (I hope!), I think the illustration and the choice of colors make this a fun and engaging read. While some of the phrases might be long and the child might skip around, they rhyme well and are funny. I can picture the child trying really hard to say 'Quoggles' and laughing before they finish vocalizing the word! Above all, what I personally got from the book was a realization that fear is all in our heads, and it takes gentle guidance and the courage to try a new way of approaching the problem to really cross a difficult bridge. While some fears are irrational, they should not be discounted, but addressed with a solution-centric view. This book is all about that. I think children and adults alike will get a lot from this book. Happy Reading!"

This fascinating story takes readers on the incredible journey into man’s efforts to save diminishing habitats and the creatures that depend on them. What a hopeful story! It will undoubtably inspire readers to dream up other possibilities for improving our world."

To be upfront, Greg and I share a few mutual friends, this has afforded me the opportunity to receive an advance digital copy of his memoir in exchange for an honest review. As a reviewer, my reflections come from being an individual who experiences attractions to the same-sex and is a Christian with traditional values."

        "The title of the book takes its cue from the author’s attempt to navigate the waters of being single, gay, and Christian. For Greg, his identity is rooted firmly in Christ. My understanding of Greg’s view, as taken from his writing, is one in which he views his homosexuality as being a minor note in light of Christ, but as something that is present and being informed, transformed and redeemed in Christ for the glory of God."

        "Greg is unapologetically from the beginning an evangelical Christian. He makes clear through his witness that our only response as evangelicals to the current sexual revolution is a further commitment to a traditional sexual ethic. In his asides, which are personally my favorite parts of the book, he stresses a gospel of grace and hope. That our only hope is one in which Christ redeems the entirety of our being. Like Wesley Hill’s classic ‘Washed and Waiting,” there is a strong emphasis on living in the expectant hope of Christ."

The five-day guide provides recommendations, tips, currency, country code, emergency numbers, local airports, and explains about how emergency treatment is provided for free in public hospitals for visitors. I was surprised about that. August is the high season. Bring a good pair of walking shoes. The guide tells you what important items you won't want to forget. Sightseeing highlights included as well as hidden treasures of less-known gems you won't want to miss. Etiquette for greeting, dining, and smoking is provided. Information provided regarding tipping. There are bike, boat, and walking tours as well as bus or car. There is even a five-day itinerary provided that you can play around with to suit your personal tastes and add or subtract activities for a fun-filled, well-balanced time in Barcelona! It's a big city, but walkable during five days, according to the guide, or you can rent a bike. Restaurants and hotel information included. A book full of tips and necessary information that I highly recommend if you want to have a safe, fun-filled trip."

I remember being simultaneously transfixed and skewered; we had talked endlessly about the death she wanted but here was a book addressing all the same issues—PLUS an Ancient Egyptian plot line AND two romances AND an Irish twist. It was too real to read but I couldn’t put it down. In retrospect, the bravest reader was really my mom. A series of coincidences led me to re-read it now, nearly two years after I sat with her while she died, and the power of it came right back and smacked me in the heart. I couldn’t pause—I read it straight through. I loved it even more the second time, and I think as I continue to age and experience more death (and practice seeing the beauty in it) I will repeatedly earn myself a re-read. It’s a fantastic book with no shortage of glorious eye-opening moments that keep on giving. Thanks for writing this."

Now, I guess I didn't have any great expectations or great curiosity about Wolverine's past and kind of focused on the stories that were set in the present and when I was growing up with Wolverine, most stories were set in a 'present' timeline. Although his past was alluded to, it was always shrouded in mystery and I was content with that. Suddenly, I come across this book (12 years after it's original release) and it intrigued me. I didn't have any expectations and I read that it was set in the 1800's. Ok, that's not an issue for me. Why would it be? Wolverine is over a 100 years old after all."

        "This is the true origin of Wolverine, taking us through a significant part of his childhood to young adult. It's not a traditional superhero story full of big battles and  cheesy one liners. It is a serious novel that provides revelations into Wolverines early life, showing the influence that part of his life had on partly moulding what he is today. It does this through great story telling that involves the melancholy, child abuse, domestic violence, classism, love, hate, rejection, friendship and great tragedy, with a mutant twist. It tells of how logan got his name, gives us an insight into his part feral nature, why he likes red heads and shows us the moment his claws were known to exist. But more than concrete revelation, it is full of exciting mystery as we are left to decide who Wolverine's real father is..i.e. the grounds keeper who looks just like him or the estate owner (i guess it's pretty obvious who it is). What is the story behind Wolverine's (or James Howlett's as he was known then) deceased brother? Why does his mother have the scars of 3 claw marks on her back? These answer to  things aren't spelt out for you but rather implied and you have to work it out yourself. The story also introduces us to the redhead nanny who looks after him and the groundkeepers son who seems to hate James. So there is mystery and conspiracy within this book, not to mention great drama. The story also ends in a way that shows how he may have met up with silverfox."

It leaves out the boring (to younger reader) details in places, as well some of the mention of the most adult themes (details of Corrie's romantic crush on Karel, mentions of sex, prostitutes, death of a newborn baby in the camp etc.) The brutality in the concentration camp is not softened, as it shouldn't be.  The illustrations help a lot with visualizing the context that would be harder for kids.  The overall theme of this period of history is difficult to stomach period, but if you are looking for a milder introduction for children 12 and under (or even older  sensitive children), this is a good option.

He begins by talking about his mother's love of food:  \"there was a daily, almost obsessive focus on the quality of the ingredients, their careful preparation the passing on of family recipes, and cultural and culinary traditions.\"  Weaving stories, recipes, and descriptions of food experiences and traditions we learn about Tucci as a young man, actor, and family man.  We also learn about his values.  For example, his mother exhorted, \"You can't know if you don't like something if you haven't had it.  You have to try it.  You have to try everything.\"  He described food as \"connective tissue\" bringing people together.  Tucci noted, \"if you're a food lover, there is always something gratifying about connecting with the vegetable, the fruit, or whatever animal, whether you've grown it, raised it, or hunted it, before it becomes your food.  But to make that connection and then connect with someone else simultaneously is an exalted, almost spiritual level of foodie intimacy.\"  He reserved his experience of throat cancer until the chapter.  It was as though, the prior chapters were the prelude to fully understanding how threatening oropharyngeal cancer would be to a man who clearly loves food.  His diagnosis meant that for almost two years, he primarily ate easy to swallow foods.  Reflecting, he said: \"Food at once grounded me and took me to other places.  It comforted me and challenged me.  It was part of the fabric that made up my creative self and my domestic self.\""

Had this been one of the foundational books that my mom or dad had read to me at bedtime when I was a young boy, this book (especially read to me by them) could have changed the trajectory of my life and saved me literally decades of self-hatred and ineffective therapy."

I grew up surrounded and bombarded by late '60s/early '70s feminist messages predicated on the idea that men and boys are bad and girls and women were the only ones with the positive traits that the world needed. Wired as a sensitive, intuitive boy, I picked up on the messages that I was inherently bad and that my greatest gift to society would be to elevate and support women ... while determinedly NOT BEING, trying to have my existence have as little impact on women and girls as possible. By age 10, I wanted to die. When a boy hears women saying things within earshot of him like, \"Men are the urine on the toilet seat of life\" (yes, a woman in a group I was in said that), it's easy for him in his immature understanding to think that the most altruistic thing he could do for the women and girls of the world would be to die."

I'm a fan of aviation and have always been fascinated by modern war history, so why not give it a go? But this book turned out not to be what I expected. It is indeed a remarkable war tale involving two exceptional men of different backgrounds. However it is also so much more than that. At Devotion’s core is a harrowing re-counting of the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir--one of the Korean War's most significant and horrifying battles--as told from the viewpoints of multiple real people both on the ground and in the air.*** The author attempts to put you into the frostbitten bodies of its main characters as they haplessly endure wave after wave of night attacks from bayonet-baring Chinese soldiers, all the while praying for air support that cannot come."

I never knew how weapons froze at night so commonly that skirmishes were won or lost via bayonet and hand-to-hand combat (ugh). I never knew that so many Chinese and North Korean POWs elected NOT to return to their home countries at the war's end (what a telling choice), and that the thorny issue of their repatriation was what kept the war going for so long."

Not just in regard to hard research, but many of the world's finest novelists have fictionalized the story, film makers have touched upon the subject, playwrights, composers, painters and poets. If there has been a way to express the shock- and shock is an understatement in this case- it has been attempted."

        " John Boyne, a gifted and now internationally known Irish author, wrote the book \"The Boy In The Stripped Pajamas\" in about two weeks time. As he said, in order to maintain \"the voice,\" once he began he was afraid to stop. The same is true when reading it- we are compelled to continue and it is evident from early in the book that Boyne has disguised the terminal words so that it can apply to any and all of the other holocausts' that occurred prior to and after this one. In fact, only once does Boyne choose to use a \"telling\" word; on page 54 one of the officers says, \"Heil Hitler\" but then we are told that the boy assumed that this was like saying, \"Well, goodbye for now and have a pleasant afternoon.\""

The negative pun- the only way I could describe this- suggests the old work rhythm, \"In with the good; out with the bad.\" Then the boy mishears the Furher as The Fury\" and this negative pun needs no description at all. We have a moment when Bruno meets \"The Fury\" as well as \"her\" when they come for dinner and Bruno is appalled at how small The Fury is, but how kind the beautiful blonde woman with him is (her name is simply Eva)."

        "This is one of the most touching books I've ever read. Agee has the greatest knack of talking in the language of the character under examination. His attention to minute detail brings the picture of what the characters see and do and feel in a way that I find rather profound. The language is never coarse or overly broad. You never have to guess what a sentence is conveying, it is so literate yet to the point. For instance, Agee names all the mourners, just the way a child would who was watching them pass by one by one, and creates an atmosphere of the burden of sadness but not understanding why the burden is put forth."

        "Young Rufus' character and personality come across as the most touching of all. He is a young boy starting to mature but still captured in childhood, and trying to understand people and their behaviors toward him, trying to trust but knowing and feeling puzzled by the things people do to him to destroy that trust. And learning he can't trust himself either. Everyone can relate to his trials in this regard. All the folks who populate this book are folks you'd want to know more about. But the most touching aspect of all is the way Agee lets you know just how the death of one impacts so many, so very many others; how it hurts, how it forces growth, how much sadness it generates. I couldn't put it down. And my tears still flow thinking about it."

Briefly I lived in the same neighborhood in the 1990s.  It seemed to be a collection of essays, some of which didn't quite fit together.  The language was lovely but there was a lot of verbal diarrhea - places where he went on and on when the same point could have been made in half as many words (for instance the discussion of Rufus standing by his house waiting for the big boys to come by before/after school)."

I was very excited to read the book, but was sorely disappointed. I know a movie's novelization isn't supposed to be exactly like the movie persay, but this was very poorly written. I will give him props for developing Lancelot's character, but that was it. The author took Dagonet, for example, (who was my favorite character from the film) and changed him from a quiet, brave warrior into this dumb, brute-like brainless idiot. The book had a few spots where the dialogue was sweet in its way, mostly in the parts dealing with Lucan, but all in all this novelization wasn't worth reading, in my opinion."

Iako to nije u pravom smislu reči nastavak romana Zovem se Lusi Barton, zajednička crta svih protagonista je da su u nekom trenutku svog života bili u nekakvoj vezi s Lusi i varošicom Amgaš u Ilinoisu. Između ostalih, tu su dve sestre, nekada najlepše devojke u gradu, od kojih je jedna zarad bogatog muža žrtvovala samopoštovanje, dok je druga na stranicama knjige pronašla srodnu dušu koja joj je promenila život. Vera penzionisanog školskog domara biva stavljena na probu nakon dobronamerne posete jednom samotnjaku. Odrasla ćerka žudi za majčinom ljubavlju čak i kad ode u inostranstvo kako bi je posetila i prihvatila činjenicu da joj je majka napokon srećna. Lusi Barton se kao sredovečna žena vraća posle sedamnaestogodišnjeg odsustva da poseti brata i sestru, i tada prvi put otvoreno razgovaraju o svom teškom detinjstvu i prisećaju se događaja koje su možda namerno zaboravili.",

For a man who forgets things so easily, he seems to have an easier time recalling memories of a life that wasn't exactly his. Or was it? Struggling to piece together his forgotten past, he ends up befriending Edward Barrett, a young man who needs a little help of his own —but with his future. Through the bonds of an unexpected friendship, crossing several generations of past and present time, the two men learn that sometimes fiction, although not always real, has the power to expose the most truth.

I don't read contemporary that often (when I do, it's in the romantic comedic vein of Sophie Kinsella or Helen Fielding), but I was intrigued by the premise of The Notebook meets Water for Elephants, I knew I had to give it a try. I was not disappointed. The Taming of Lions is a quieter story that will remain with you long after you've finished the book. I have so much respect for authors who can pull off symbolism in their novels without literally beating their readers in the face with it and Danie does just that (her way of bringing up her themes in the novel were on a level I don't think I could ever reach). Her characters are so well fleshed out, I felt like I was reading a memoir about real people and not a work of fiction. This is a book I don't think I can recommend enough!"

Pulling off a memorable first quote is hard and Danie nailed it!

The story of Spartacus, born a slave, trained as a gladiator, who led a slave revolt that was eventually put down by Crassus, was immensely popular, and went on to sell millions of copies.

        "Everyone knows the basic story of Spartacus, the anonymous third-generation slave sold to a gladiator school to fight for the amusement of decadent Romans, and how he ended up leading a gigantic slave rebellion that nearly destroyed the Republic. What Fast explores in the novel is how and why this rebellion came about, and what effect it had on the psychology of the Romans, whose culture even during the years of the Republic was enormously dependent on slavery. Most importantly, Fast explores the moral climate of Rome by following around the \"victors\" of the Servile War as they reminisce about Spartacus and how he was defeated. It is in this backward-looking manner that \"Spartacus\" unfolds."
      ],
      [
        "E.S. Kraay",
        "Fast draws his characters, most of whom are real-life figures, with wonderful clarity: Crassus, the general who crushed Spartacus' rebellion, is shown as \"the bronze hawk of the Republic\" -- ruthless, sensual, grasping, yet ultimately hollow; Cicero, the historian-philsopher, as a scheming opportunist of the worst sort; Gracchus as a basically decent man turned cynical and decayed by the evils of his society. The lesser Roman characters are much worse: empty-headed, venal, vain, cruel, parastic, sexually depraved, almost unspeakably vicious and treacherous, all holding onto illicit fortunes wrung from the sweat and labor of slaves, and all desperate to increase their wealth, power and position relative to each other. Nor are the common folk of the cities and towns spared: Fast depicts them in passing as a lazy, bloodthirsty, amoral mob who live for cheap wine and the grain dole and the games, who \"strangle their children at birth\" and whore themselves on the streets for pennies."

Penned by Nanak, the first Guru of the Sikhs, it occupies a pivotal position in Sikh Philosophy. The coded language and compact style of this verse make it easy to recite but difficult to understand. Though most Sikhs chant it daily in the morning, few of them claim to know its authentic meaning. The void between chanting and understanding has led to a mushroom growth of interpretations of the text.All these interpretations, however, portray it as a manual of worship while on closure look it displays the characteristics of a manual of science. Scripted by Guru Nanak in the medieval times when all science was in infancy, it may truly be called the first ever manifesto of science. However, because it appeared before the intellectual environment was ripe for its right evaluation it was listed as a religious text and began to be used as such.The work in hand does not share the assumptions and beliefs expressed in this type of interpretations. Brushing aside their subjective bias and methodological flaws, it makes an objective approach to narrow down on the original message of the Master contained in this unique composition. Confining strictly to the domain of objectivity, it applies the proven techniques of scientific method for decoding and interpreting this poetic text. It makes a realistic attempt to trace the possible correlations between the wisdom contained in this classic and the vision of the modern science. It is neither an opinion nor a religious discourse but a positive endeavor to read the mind of Guru Nanak through his own creation.",

The series line, \"Where One System Fails, Another Never Gives Up!\", becomes clearer as you read the character's backstory and by the book's end, you're even more excited to read book three. Kudos to Brooklyn for writing a prequel that wasn't just filler between books two and three, and for making it more as a preview for the conclusion to the story."

Others seem sure it was Thursday. It was early October. Unless it was late September; but almost half a century has passed since the events of that day, and the turmoil of the days and weeks that followed, and no one, at that time or since, thought to write it all down.

First rescuing Joe, although the whale was primarily responsible for his rescue, and then the whale. The old African proverb - It takes a village to raise a child needs an addendum, a P.S., …or rescue a whale… An act that seems impossible, impossible even to contemplate, yet alone perform. But interdependence is one of those characteristics common among even the curmudgeonliest villages, and this small village of St. Piran is ready, willing, and mostly able to be a part of this historic event."

I’ve completed my training and working on my certification for teaching tweens, teens, and adults how to track cycles for health, prevention, or conception and wanted to see what was covered. The information in this book contradicted itself, repeated itself, read in a very choppy way, heavy promotion of hormonal birth control, and missed valuable cycle information, plus natural options for pain points. Extremely basic informational book, I would not recommend for someone looking to really understand or explain what is happening in a young girls body. Maybe for a very general barebones basic overview, yet some of the topics covered are for older teens versus younger tweens, example sex while menstruating. There is also promotion that pregnancy can happen anytime during a cycle which has scientifically been found as false."

In these stories, the author is picturing the most intimate human relationships represented through the patriarchal values of society, but also through its political and socio-economic patterns. The main themes the book encapsulates are economic migration and the distorted human relations resulting from such a form of migration. It also depicts the inferiority complex amongst people in the Balkans towards the developed (Western) world. (translated from okno.mk)",

Jamie Vaught did a great job covering a wide variety of topics….some of the topics included are Cawood Ledford, The Fiddlin’ Five, Rupp’s Runts, Joe B. Hall, Dan Issel, Mike Pratt, Jerry Claiborne, Fran Curci, along with many others. I really enjoyed Jamie’s personal stories regarding UK Athletics and the relationships he has developed during his career. One of my favorite chapters detailed the friendship Jamie Vaught developed with Roberto Clemente as a child. The author also set out personal experiences he has had with his hearing impairment and some of the difficulties he has overcame (very inspirational)!!"

        "W Bruce Ayers",
        "As usual, Jamey Vaught has provided special insight into Kentucky basketball through the eyes of individuals who have had special access to this storied program over the years; and this volume also includes rare snippets about the football program as well!  However, the thing that sets “Still Crazy About The Cats” apart is the behind the scenes view that the author provides about his struggles—since birth—to overcome a hearing disability that left him near deaf.  The obstacles that he has faced, and overcome, rival those with which any Kentucky team has had to contend over the years.  An inspirational story."

One night, on a whim, I started reading Handling Sin. Once inside Malone's comic world, bursting with life, joy and intelligence, I was utterly hooked. A month ago, I ordered five more of his novels from Amazon.com. The first two I've read are Dingley Falls and The Delectable Mountains."

It's not Pollyanesque, not at all, for dark and tragic things happen there. There's a rape and a killing. Several people die earlier than they should have because a secret government base nearby is experimenting with no controls on biowarfare and deadly pathogens are released from time to time into the neighboring community."

Effective support for the enterprise demands the merging of these efforts into a coordinated discipline, one that incorporates best practices from both systems development and project management life cycles. Robert K. Wysocki creates that discipline in this book--a ready reference for professionals and consultants as well as a textbook for students of computer information systems and project management. By their very nature, software projects defy a \"one size fits all\" approach. In these pages you will learn to apply best-practice principles while maintaining the flexibility that's essential for successful software development. Learn how to make the planning process fit the need * Understand how and why software development must be planned on a certainty-to-uncertainty continuum * Categorize your projects on a four-quadrant model * Learn when to use each of the five SDPM strategies--Linear, Incremental, Iterative, Adaptive, and Extreme * Explore the benefits of each strategic model and what types of projects it supports best * Recognize the activities that go into the Scoping, Planning, Launching, Monitoring/Controlling, and Closing phases of each strategy * Apply this knowledge to the specific projects you manage * Get a clear picture of where you are and how to get where you want to go",

        "I have taken many courses in project management who's techniques are more geared towards defined or construction style projects and so are most books out there in the market, this book is a refreshing departure from the norm as it integrates SDLC (s) both traditional and modern with project management processes. The author gives good insight in choosing the appropriate SDLC for a given situation and then elaborates for the chosen SDLC how to set expectations, milestones and deliverables for: requirements, WBS, cost, stakeholders etc. The book does a good job at conveying the essence of the SDLC(s) and Project Management techniques however, depending on your background, I recommend that you read two books, one on SDLC (Craig Larman's Agile & Iterative development ISBN 0131111558) and the other on Project Management (Kathy Schwalbe's Information Technology Project Management ISBN: 0619215267) prior to reading this book."

Secondly, there are typos as confirmed by outside resources. It tells you the finger patterns then proceeds to explain how to play your first scale in C Major, only to leave out your 4th finger in the descending scale altogether. \"5321321\" when it should be \"54321321\". Thirdly, there is the most random religious note near the beginning out of no where which was unnecessary as it had no piano-playing information. Each chapter repeats the same oddities just for other scales and really carries no value, let alone $20 worth. This is largely overpriced; I highly recommend a different resource than this book for your piano-playing curiosities."

The Prince de Ligne lived a long and most interesting life: as a boy the War of the Austrian Succession raged around his Belgian estates, as a young officer he fought in Austrian service in the Seven Years' War, then as a senior officer he participated in the 'Potato War' as well as in the Turkish-Austrian War in the late 1780s (he wisely stayed out of the Belgian uprising against his master Joseph II). Unfortunately for him he never managed to convince Leopold II or Franz to let him fight against Napoleon (although he was rash enough to declare that Napoleon was only succesful because the Austrians were not led by himself). Outside his military life he was a writer, poet and socialite, being a valued guest at pretty much all European courts, chatting with Frederick the Great, drinking tea with Catherine the Great, gossiping with Marie Antoinette, being frowned upon for his loose behaviour by Maria Theresa & debating with Joseph II. Apparently his wit ensured his popularity throughout Europe, although his behaviour towards his wife was a bit less endearing. In the latter he was no exception, like his colleague wits he had a very liberal view on marital fidelity."

The only thing that keeps this book from being a 5-star is that the children were daunted by the small type and number of entries in the book, so they didn't read, they just looked at the pictures. Also, it was illustrated, and I think in many places a photo would have been better. But . . . I'm very glad I got it. It is a great addition to the classroom library."

As I mentioned Wizard some of the kids looked very excited, they all knew what a wizard was. When I said Fighter, the kids started to look a little befuddled but I said that was like a knight.

I am not. These were 10 and 11 year old kids, and none of them knew who Legolas was. It was at this moment that I realized that with the scattered nature of popular culture, not every kid was going have the same pop culture referents to pull from. Kids have a lot more entertainment options than when I was young, and only some of them are related to D&D."

It is possible to \"read around\" the descriptions of the specific tasks of raising sails, climbing masts, tightening ropes without understanding it all.  What is conveyed, though, is the hard toil, the beauty and capriciousness of the sea, andthe importance of loyalty and trust. Months are spent"

        "I have read all the books in this series and have enjoyed them very much. Sherryl Woods does a great job of developing her characters and by the end of her books, I often feel as satisfied as if I have eaten an exquisite meal. However, this book - completing the story of Megan and Mick - seemed rushed and way too predictable. I finished the book in record time, which led me to believe that it was shorter than the other books. Although I read the Kindle version (LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my Kindle, but that's a review for a different time) I checked the paperback edition which came in at 288 pages, I then checked the rest of the series which came in at 400 pages. Anyway, I do recommend this book if you have read the others, just don't set your expectations too high. If you haven't read any books in the series, start with the first one, The Inn At Eagle Point. You won't be disappointed."

        "This is the fourth book in the Chesapeake Shores series by Sherryl Woods.  She is a wonderful writer if you are interested in family/personality-type books.  It is a LARGE Irish family living in the northeast and each of the books in this series contains all/most of the members in the family.  However, most of the books are centered around one or two of the family members and their lives/problems/dreams.  I have now finished all but one of the books in this series and have loved each one.  The people all have such different and distinct personalities and there is some feuding, but all of the members of the family always stick together and support each other.  For someone desiring to read stories of \"happily ever after -mostly\" this is a delightful series.  I now have a friend that wants to borrow the books to read after hearing my thoughts on the books.  I picked up my first book when on a trip and it was the 8th book in the series.  I was somewhat \"lost\" in keeping the members of the family separate, but now that I have re-read that book, it was so much more interesting.  After the first one, I have searched bookstores, library book sales, and on-line dealers to finish completing my set!  It was well worth the effort and I am sure I will be re-reading this series several times!"

There is nothing showing how to do a multi-embellished lay-out with other things besides stamps. There is 143 pages in this book."

I'd say 80% of those people don't know the extent to which this exodus devastated native Nations and mired them in distrust. This book offers a window with a wide view, touching a little on many other nations, but focusing on John Ross, Principle Cheif for the Cherokee, and Andrew Jackson, U.S. general and President. The author draws lines between them for their situations in early life, battles fought together, tenacity, and desire to do what they thought their people wanted. He then drives them apart with Jackson's betray, broken promises, deceit, selfishness, and tangled legal web. The mere fact that Jackson withheld his veto (by a day) on a bill his supporters wanted, just to approve an illegitimate treaty, speaks volumes. It's maddening to know how close Ross was to success. Just a vote--if only the voters had realized they were about to sacrifice their moral compass just to cast their lots with someone who would betray their interests as well."

A state's right beat, swindle, dispose of, destroy, and displace people who legally live within its perceived borders. To hold a land lottery and give away thriving farms right out from under people's feet. A state's right to ignore the Supreme Court and have Jackson turn a blind eye. The right to buy and sell human beings became the cornerstone, once natives left. Occasionally a state defies federal law in a way we consider moral, but these particular acts wouldn't stand today. At least I hope not."

It was one of their favorite and most read book. They are all adults now with their own children. I've saved all their books and toys so I went looking for the book all over the house to read to my grand-kiddies but could not find it anywhere. My first born had taken it to his home without my knowledge so he could read it to his children. I can still hear them recite the nursery rhymes with their toddler lisps LOL.

But their world also contained love and magic, along with alcoholism and domestic violence. Crews was attuned to the nature that surrounded him and took for granted his parents' fights over his father's drinking, his close relationship with a black tenant family on the farm, and everyone around him being poor, illiterate, and marked or maimed by physical labor, accidents, and animals."

He was a loving father to Crews and his brother, but he grew increasingly drunk and absent. Life on the farm was incredibly hard, but as I said, magical for young Harry. Then he was briefly and painfully crippled by polio at about age five and, just as he recovered, horribly burned when he fell into scalding water at a hog butchering."

Even amidst a rich storytelling culture, in which stories immortalized, explained, and helped people endure an unforgiving and often desperate life, Auntie stood out. Her tales, which emphasized unknowable power and mystery and the importance of protective rituals, didn't provide comprehension of phenomena but a way to live with them. Crews learned well—what a fine storyteller is riveting our attention on his life from ages five to about 10, with a flash forward at the end."

Life as we all new it was changed and the kids became very difficult - this book opened up my eyes to not only deal with my children but has taught me life long lessons about how to talk to people so they will listen.  The exercises opened my eyes to just how changing how I worded a sentence to someone could change how they responded to what I was asking.  I now recommend this book to every single parent I meet.  I made this purchase to have an extra on hand because I lend my other one out so often.  I would purchase this book again and again."

An important side benefit is that I can now get better better cooperation, partly because when I don't it's because I am wrong and now have a way to figure that out and correct it. The skills I learned serve me well with family and at work in ways I could not have predicted. Simple powerful communication skills. The Gold Standard for parenting."

You could be an absolutely amazing parent and you will find at least one thing in here that you could improve on to better you're listening and communicating skills with your child."

        "The topic of genetics can be incredibly difficult to grasp, but Ms. Kulkarni expertly breaks it down and explains it in “A Junior Scientist’s Guide to Genetics.” This book is not only perfect for elementary, middle, and high school students, but it can also be beneficial to adults that want to learn, or refresh their understanding, about the basics of genetics. This book would be a wonderful addition to a science teacher’s reading list for extra credit because not only will the student learn by reading the book, but the learning experience is enhanced even more because there are also experiments included in this book. In addition to education, I think that this book could also be useful to clinics and hospitals, nonprofit organizations, and other entities that need to explain genetics to others.  This book is also extremely timely and relevant because Ms. Kulkarni addresses COVID-19 and the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The most impressive part of all of this is that Ms. Kulkarni wrote, illustrated, and graphically designed this entire book…as a junior in high school!"

After being tired of getting out of traps Inky decides to take a break at the aquarium where he hangs with Blotchy, another octopus. Inky is constantly telling Blotchy about all of his daring escapes so one day Blotchy challenges Inky to escape from the tank. Inky relishes this opportunity and decides he will go one step further and escape the entire aquarium. Blotchy doesn’t believe Inky can do it but Inky knows there are two key components to a successful plan: patience and opportunity. Time goes by and Blotchy grows more weary that Inky won’t be able to do it. Definitely check this tale out if you want to know if Inky makes it out of the aquarium! We loved the bright illustrations and the wonderful story of bravery of Inky!"

From the odds and ends Stout let drop from time to time we learned that Wolfe had originally come from Montenegro where he had let an adventurous life while Archie was originally from Ohio and had traveled to New York City to seek adventure and his fortune but Stout never told us how the unlikely pair had ever even met, much less came to work together."

He has accepted a job as a nightwatchman on the docks, not much of a job but enough to survive.  Unfortunately for Archie he did his job a bit too well and found himself once again out of work.

This is a really interesting collectible that should be treasured."

        "This is a really good book, not the best. There are some things taught in here that seem out of place, as well mis-interpritation of karma. The book is mainly about seeing this awaken realm and sleep realm as undifferent, yet in awaken reakm we dream up our world. It turns from traditional teachings to psychology. Which seem to spine of the spiritual path, but one has to meditate on the reading and allow self return back on the path for better understanding. The book can start with being fun, but it can also ride with depressing, but sooner or later it returns to something happy to read. The book seem not to well writen, much wors seemed lost it the typing that made when you read sound no real wording. It may just be the book was rushed to print? As for the nature of karma? He talks about karma as a baggage, which is a common new age belief. But that is wrong. What he was destribing was karmaic trace, which can create karma if one allows such to get out of control. While karma is action, in short. It is the Cause/Effect, Action/Reaction, Attachments. Which you think of a boomerang and glue paper. As karmic trace is more like a seeds of positive or negative that is embedaed in our self from some event. If the bad one explose, acting to it is acting on creating bad karma. Just leting it flow and not feeding into it, on prevents from creating bad karma."

You can endure your wounds or you can enjoy your glory. You can live the life of a victim, burdened by the traumas of your past, or you can live the life of a hero, but you can't do both.

Each book carrying a little more of each family and the love and caring they have for each other the hardships and no judgment of their pasts. A few years ago I found out that my and my husband both have a Scottish heritage if you go by our names... My maiden name is Harper under Clan Buchanan and my married name Tullis  under Clan MacDuff. My father  when I think of him I always picture as a Scottish highlander because of his size, he was 6'4\" weighed close to 400 lbs., not fat by any means. He had huge hands and arms and chest. So when I read about the men I picture him. My sons are all 6'2 and 6'3 my daughters  5'10  & 5'11.  Two of my grandsons are 6'4 and 6'5 and one 6'2 my granddaughters 5'9, 5'10 & 5'11.

        "If you are a follower of the events of WWII, this is the second best book to read!! The first best  is Shirer's other book \"The Rise and Fall of the  Third Reich\". This man was a journalist in Germany on the radio during the war and has written with amazing insight to the events that led up to Hitler's realm of power and eventual collapse. If you have ever wondered how events could have gone that far, these two books tell it as it was through his own personal experiences at the time and other correspondences from the newspapers, radio, and personal connections with the  Nazis. This diary is written and notating his thoughts as the events were happening all around him. It has great personal worth and feelings. The \"Rise\" book goes into all that happened combining his personal experiences as well as info that occurred during  the  Nuremberg trials.  You can't know as much as you think you do about Germany WWI  until  you have read these 2 books. I also recommend that you also go one step further and should read \"Mein  Kampf\" by Hitler.  It is not just an evil book written to talk you into hating Jewish people. Don't worry , you won't be brainwashed into becoming a Nazi, I promise you.  It is an amazing book that actually tells you directly from  Hitler's own mind (not from some  writer who conjectures what was going on) why he did what he did. When you read this  book, you will understand so much more about why and how Hitler did his infamous deeds. (He actually believed that God inspired him to his actions for the sake of Germany, the  fatherland and its owners. It is  ponderous and at times you may want to quit it, but you will be rewarded with many scary and insightful  statements that give important clues about his reason for his actions. You will be amazed about how astute he was on some issues and psychology. It is unfortunate that he, like so many other dictators, eventually go completely mad with power which, fortunately for all of us, result in their eventual downfall. It is a crying shame that it ends with the deaths of so many innocent people over the whole world."

It is more than that, for history lovers and concerned current event followers, as it reads like a novel but gives much insider information that is gathered by a reporter, that either doesn't get printed and written up in later history books and then current large newspapers and publications, even from inside a highly difficult and censored German and Europe preparing, than entering WWII."

After all, patience had played a big part in holding on for the day that Luke would see Ava as more than just a friend. What transpired wasn’t what Ava had in mind, a no strings sexual relationship that had to be free of emotion. Years passed while the two met several times a year to give into their needs, but all of that changed the moment Ava confessed that this meant more than just a fling."

Thomas is the complete opposite of Luke. The rugged rocker could have any female that lines up at his door, but that doesn’t keep him from wanting to make Ava the center of his universe. Determined to bring sunshine back into Ava’s life, Thomas opens the door to all the possibilities that he can offer a woman who clearly should have been worshipped all these years. Making Ava forget the past is easier said than done, but nothing will prepare the two for the journey that their lives will take from this point forward."

Marc Brown does such a good job at placing real kids thoughts and feelings onto his characters!  In this book D.W. is having a birthday party which is themed around her favorite, Mary Moo Cow.

Each topic contains personal anecdotes, supportive advice and fun, relevant quotes.  Unlike some self-help books, it is not pretentious.  It feels more like sitting down with a friend over a cup of coffee. The reader will learn how to successfully approach life's milestones and overcome life's curveballs. As Prof. Graz points out, sometimes even when we do what is expected the outcome is less than we anticipate.  He gives the reader tips on how to deal with this type of disappointment and how to avoid it.  One of the lessons repeated throughout the shortcuts is that you should be true to yourself and not feel responsible for or accountable to the expectations of others. This book is packed with encouragement for readers in all stages of life."

The advice is direct,to the point, and easy to absorb, which is not always the case in a self help book.  He obviously is a writer who is both interested and interesting and his writing reveals these qualities.  For those who struggle with any type of decision making process, or who constantly search for the right path,( don’t we all?)…….this book is for you."

I am getting off of my anti-depressant using \"The Feelings\" kit from Young Living, some supplements, much prayer and finding self love which is amazingly healing and freedom giving. There is so much info packed into this! You should definitely settle down in a warm and comfy spot with no distractions, a cup of tea, and have your diffuser running one of the oils (if you have the kit) such as Surrender, Forgiveness, Inner Child, Harmony,( to name a few) and just consume this book. It is life-changing my friends, and if you have the right brand, the right kind of oils to use you will certainly have that epiphany or spiritual awakening several times. It covers every inch of the systems, mind, body and spirit fully and easy to understand and read.

I know what they said about his mom but a little something of \"she passed peacefully in her sleep\" doesn't seem like that big of a deal. Sadly there was only 1 chapter of Storm's pov. I know it's not his story but he's my favorite & I can't get enough! Would only recommend if you want to continue the series."

I thought that the initial meeting between Darcy and Trevor was contrived. How many American's named Trevor are going to be on the building crew? How many men named Trevor do *you* know? (G). It's not a common name. Ms. Roberts would have done better to give him some family nickname he could have given Darcy without lying about what he was called. That entire scene was an insult to Darcy's intelligence."

I love reading, especially when it's a topic I'm very interested in or passionate about so it really is an easy book to read.  It's a great book because it breaks things down from before you conceive, then week by week of your pregnancy and what to expect at each stage in general.  It is very good at covering all types of people from young to old and different lifestyles and choices you may have made in the past or are still currently making and how this may or may not affect your pregnancy."

For example, I have never smoked or done drugs... there's a page or two on if you are currently doing these things and what you should do, or look out for, or how it may or may not affect your baby, etc... I read some of it due to curiosity but skipped the rest because it just didn't apply.  This book seems very non-judgmental in that it doesn't make you feel like a terrible person if you have done these things (or are currently) etc... it just helps you to make the best/healthiest decisions while you are pregnant."

Your home or work computer and their lawyer. Options for reducing the cost of your case. Ways to make your child kidnap resistant, and able to contact you. Information a child must have to escape.

We wondered which of the lies and fantasies would be believed by the court and how much they would affect an unjust decision. After reading this book, we understand what is an issue to the court and what is not an issue to the court, and what is under the father's control and what is not under the father's control.  The mother's depressing and manipulative behavior is now recognizable to us and we can better predict what is coming and prepare for it. The book is set up in an easy to use manner. One can look up the problem one is having by subject and it is not necessary to read about areas that have not come up in your situation. Businesswise, we experienced very helpful customer service to correct  an order mistake we made."

I was scared that I would be wasting my money but I found it easy to read, easy to use, and easy to apply to your personal child custody war. I'm glad I took the plunge because I feel much better now that I know what I should be doing to get my little girl back.

Each 2 page spread has an incredible amount of detail that keeps you lingering. I really love how in some of the scenes there’s quirky little things added.  For example in the sea otters you’ll see an otter mischievously sticking his tongue out or in the hammerheads scene you’ll find one with a bouquet of flowers. At first I just thought it was a silly little detail to keep the kids interested but then I noticed at the end of the book there’s a game of “Can you find?”  I cannot express how much I love this book. It’s definitely going to be one that gets well worn corners and pages."

        "I recently went thrift-shopping and this book was buried at the bottom of a stack of used books. I think it was the colors of the cover that caught my eye and I immediately fell in love with the illustrations! I took it home without even reading it, which is very rare for me with kids' books. I will almost always at least skim the story before I buy, but this one went home with me based solely on the cover and the title."

I adore how it's centered around the little girl's stuffed animals and toys and their adventures in her imagination. There are some introductions to genies, pirates, sea monsters, and many things that set little readers up for a love of fantasy."
